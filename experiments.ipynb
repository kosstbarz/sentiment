On the DVD special feature about the making of 'Quintet,' it's clear that even Altman didn't know what the movie was supposed to be. It's set in some distant future when the world is in the grip of another ice age. The film was shot at the abandoned site of the Montreal Expo '67, and I do have to admit that this gives the movie some interesting production design elements, even if much of it looks like it's being filmed in an iced-over shopping mall. Paul Newman, looking zonked out and absolutely disinterested in anything going on around him, and Brigitte Fossey, play drifters who wander into this futuristic city looking for Newman's brother.

      "Reasoning: The movie moved me more than I was expecting, and I was fully prepared to cry. The acting mainly carried this film, with superb performances from Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, as well as the supporting cast. These actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they lingered the remainder of the night with me, and I had trouble shaking this war drama. The costumes and cinematography were also magical, but didn't get carried away with themselves. They didn't take focus, but added to the whole effect. Cold Mountain could never become my favorite movie, as that title will always belong to The English Patient, but it's in the top five. The story itself was well developed, and stayed fairly unpredictable. I did not find myself guessing what line came next. A heart-wrenching story about humanity and war. In fact, this movie was so strongly real that it was barely noticeable it took place in the 19th century.>\n",

It's so bad it's not even laughable. The special effects (did I say 'special'?) were probably achieved spending a couple of grand, the acting is terrible and the script should have ended up in the trash bin after the first read by the studio that decided to take on this miserable project. The whole movie was literally filmed in a warehouse. Also, for you guys out there who like nudity in your movies, don't be fooled by the R rating.

    "- Prompt engineering helped to dramatically increase quality of 0.5B model, but still quality of 1.5B is better, which is expected.\n",
    "- 0.5B with label prompt is close to 1.5 with initial prompt.\n",
    "- Reasoning helpes to debug some problems, but doesn't improve quality for both models.\n",
    "- 0.5B shows disballance with small recall, which means it often labels positive reviews as negative.\n",
